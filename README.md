# vscode_latex_workspace

A minimal workspace that sets up vs-code to become a pleasant Latex development environment. This template only takes care of Latex, you still need to make sure you have a Latex distribution running.

## Getting started

Download this repository and open the folder in VS-code, VS-code should be opened INSIDE the folder!
A pop up should appear that suggests the required extensions, install these.

## spell checking

This setup uses cspell and does English language checks,
to stop cspell from giving a warning for words, them to the top of the file with:
% cspell:words blabla, ignoremepls, somethingsomething.

## TODO's

To prevent accidentally leaving visible TODO's in your document, this workspace highlights commented out TODO's.
Additionally you can list all the todo's in your document by pressing the List TODOs button in the bottom bar of vscode.
